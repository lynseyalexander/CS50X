# CS50X

This free Harvard course provided by OpenCourseWare teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Please do not copy the code if you are also taking CS50X, that would be against the courses academic honesty policy. You must only sumbit your own code. Thank you.
